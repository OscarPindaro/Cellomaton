## Problems
right now i have a problem with the movement interface, since it expects to be in the tree.
What is happening is that the speed while moving randomly doesnt change, and also the control step is not working.
For the follow movement it's working perfectly, because the speed is not updated with a timer, but it depends on the target body.
A possible solution can be to just randomly select the speed, and i guess it's good idea.
Maybe next time i'll implement a state machine?
